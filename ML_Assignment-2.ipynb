    "#### Q1 What is regression analysis?\n",
    "Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model and analyze the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal is to understand how the dependent variable changes when any one of the independent variables is varied while the others are held fixed.\n",
    "Example: Predicting house prices (dependent) based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms (independent).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q2 Explain the difference between linear and nonlinear regression.\n",
    "**Linear Regression**: Assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. It models the relationship by fitting a straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) through the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nonlinear Regression**: Used when the relationship between variables is not linear. It fits a curve (e.g., polynomial, exponential, logarithmic) to the data points. The model may involve complex functions, and the relationship can be more flexible than linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, linear regression assumes a straight-line relationship, while nonlinear regression can model more complex, curved relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q3 What is the difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression?\n",
    "**Simple Linear Regression**: Involves one dependent variable and one independent variable. It fits a straight line through the data points.\n",
    "Example: Predicting house price based on square footage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple Linear Regression**: Involves one dependent variable and two or more independent variables. It fits a hyperplane in a multi-dimensional space to the data points.\n",
    "Example: Predicting house price based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q4 How is the performance of a regression model typically evaluated?\n",
    "The performance of a regression model is typically evaluated using metrics such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values.\n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values.\n",
    "Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of the mean squared error.\n",
    "R-squared (R¬≤): The proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.\n",
    "These metrics help in assessing the accuracy of the model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q5 What is overfitting in the context of regression models?\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a regression model captures the noise or random fluctuations in the training data rather than the underlying relationship. This results in a model that performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data (test data).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q6 What is logistic regression used for?\n",
    "Logistic regression is used for binary classification problems, where the outcome is a categorical variable with two possible values (e.g., success/failure, yes/no or 0/1).or 0/1. It models the probability of one class occurring based on the independent variables, using the logistic function to produce values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q7 How does logistic regression differ from linear regression?\n",
    "**Linear Regression**: Used for predicting continuous outcomes(e.g., predicting house prices). It models the relationship between independent variables and a continuous dependent variable using a straight line.\n",
    "**Logistic Regression**: Used for predicting binary or categorical outcomes(e.g., predicting yes/no or success/failure). It uses the logistic function to model the probability of the dependent variable being one of the categories.\n",
    "Note : linear regression is for continuous outcomes, while logistic regression is for categorical or binary outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q8 Explain the concept of odds ratio in logistic regression.\n",
    "The odds ratio is a measure of association between an independent variable and the outcome. It represents the ratio of the odds of the outcome occurring when the independent variable is present (or for a one-unit increase in the variable) to the odds of the outcome occurring when the independent variable is absent (or for a one-unit decrease).\n",
    "\n",
    "An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates a positive association, while an odds ratio less than 1 indicates a negative association. An odds ratio of 1 means no effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q9 What is the sigmoid function in logistic regression?\n",
    "The sigmoid function, also known as the logistic function, is used to map predicted values to probabilities. It outputs a value between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary classification,  where the output represents the probability of the positive class.. The function is defined as \n",
    "ùúé(ùë•)=1/(1+ùëí‚àíùë•)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q10 How is the performance of a logistic regression model evaluated?\n",
    "The performance of a **logistic regression model** is typically evaluated using the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly predicted instances (both positive and negative).\n",
    "2. **Precision**: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions, indicating how many predicted positives are actual positives.\n",
    "3. **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives, showing how well the model detects positive cases.\n",
    "4. **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics when there is an uneven class distribution.\n",
    "5. **ROC-AUC**: The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, which plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate, representing the model's ability to distinguish between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance, especially for imbalanced datasets or binary classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q11 What is a decision tree?\n",
    "A **decision tree** is a machine learning algorithm that models decisions and their possible consequences in a tree-like structure. It splits the data into subsets based on the values of input features, forming branches that lead to decision nodes. These nodes represent conditions or decisions, and the **leaf nodes** represent the final predicted outcomes or classes. Decision trees are used for both classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q12 How does a decision tree make predictions?\n",
    "A decision tree makes predictions by traversing from the root of the tree to a leaf node, following the branches based on the values of the input features. The leaf node contains the predicted outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q13 What is entropy in the context of decision trees?\n",
    "Entropy is a measure of the impurity or randomness in a dataset. In decision trees, it is used to determine the best feature to split the data. A split that reduces entropy the most is preferred. Lower entropy means higher purity, which is desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q14 What is pruning in decision trees?\n",
    "Pruning is the process of removing parts of the tree that do not provide additional predictive power. It helps to prevent overfitting by simplifying the tree and removing branches that are based on noise or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q15 How do decision trees handle missing values?\n",
    "**Decision trees** can handle missing values in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imputation**: Missing values are replaced with a summary statistic, such as the most frequent value (mode) for categorical features or the mean/median for numerical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Surrogate Splits**: When a decision tree encounters a missing value for a feature during a split, it uses a surrogate feature (an alternative feature) to make the split. This allows the tree to still make a decision even when the primary feature value is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods help ensure that decision trees can continue to make accurate predictions even in the presence of missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q16 What is a support vector machine (SVM)?\n",
    "A **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for **classification** and **regression** tasks. In classification, SVM finds the **hyperplane** (or decision boundary) that best separates data into different classes, maximizing the **margin** between the closest data points (support vectors) of each class. The goal is to increase the margin for better generalization to unseen data. SVM can also be extended to handle **non-linear separations** by using kernel functions (e.g., polynomial or radial basis function kernels), allowing it to perform well on more complex datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note : SVM aims to create a decision boundary with the largest possible margin between classes and can be adapted for both linear and non-linear problems through the use of kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q17 Explain the concept of margin in SVM.\n",
    "The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class. SVM aims to maximize this margin to improve the classifier's robustness and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q18 What are support vectors in SVM?\n",
    "Support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the hyperplane and are most influential in defining the position and orientation of the hyperplane. These points are critical in defining the optimal hyperplane. They are the critical elements of the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q19 How does SVM handle non-linearly separable data?\n",
    "**SVM handles non-linearly separable data** by using **kernel functions** to transform the input features into a higher-dimensional space. In this new space, it becomes possible to find a linear hyperplane that can separate the data. The kernel trick allows SVM to implicitly compute the dot product in this higher-dimensional space without explicitly performing the transformation, which makes it computationally efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Commonly used kernels include:\n",
    "    - **Polynomial Kernel**: Maps the data into a higher-dimensional polynomial feature space.\n",
    "    - **Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel (or Gaussian Kernel)**: Maps the data into an infinite-dimensional space, making it very effective for complex data distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, kernels allow SVM to effectively handle complex, non-linear decision boundaries by transforming the data into a space where it becomes linearly separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q20 What are the advantages of SVM over other classification algorithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Effective in high-dimensional spaces**: SVMs perform well when the number of features is large, making them suitable for text classification and image recognition tasks.\n",
    "2. **Robust to overfitting**: SVMs are less prone to overfitting, especially in high-dimensional space, due to the regularization parameter(C) that helps control the margin between the classes.\n",
    "3. **Versatile** : SVMs can be adapted to various tasks through the use of different kernel functions (e.g., linear, polynomial, RBF), enabling them to handle both linear and non-linear classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q21 What is the Naive Bayes algorithm?\n",
    "The **Naive Bayes algorithm** is a **probabilistic classifier** based on **Bayes' theorem**, which describes the probability of a class given the input features. The key assumption in Naive Bayes is that the features are independent of each other given the class label. This assumption is often unrealistic in many real-world scenarios, but despite this, Naive Bayes can perform surprisingly well, especially in cases like text classification (e.g., spam detection).\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by calculating the **posterior probability** for each possible class, given the input features, and then choosing the class with the highest probability. \n",
    "The **Naive Bayes** algorithm is simple, efficient, and works well for classification tasks, especially when the independence assumption holds reasonably well or when dealing with high-dimensional datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q22 Why is it called \"Naive\" Bayes?\n",
    "The algorithm is called **\"Naive\"** because of the **strong assumption** it makes: that all features are **independent** of each other, given the class label. In real-world data, this assumption is often unrealistic, as features are usually correlated. However, despite this \"naive\" assumption, the algorithm often performs surprisingly well, especially in high-dimensional problems like text classification, where feature independence is a reasonable approximation. \n",
    "**\"Naive\"** reflects the simplicity of the assumption of feature independence, which, although not always accurate, allows the algorithm to be computationally efficient and effective in many situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q23 How does Naive Bayes handle continuous and categorical features?\n",
    "**Categorical Features**: Naive Bayes uses frequency counts or probabilities from the training data to calculate the likelihood of each feature given a class.\n",
    "For example, in text classification, Naive Bayes calculates the probability of each word (categorical feature) occurring in each class, based on word frequencies.\n",
    "**Continuous Features**: Naive Bayes often assumes a Gaussian(normal) distribution for continuous features and uses the mean and standard deviation of the feature values to calculate probabilities.\n",
    "These assumptions make Naive Bayes efficient and effective, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q24 Explain the concept of prior and posterior probabilities in Naive Bayes.\n",
    "**Prior Probability**: The initial probability of a class before considering the evidence (features).\n",
    "Example: If 60% of the emails in a dataset are labeled as \"spam\" and 40% are \"not spam\", the prior probability for \"spam\" would be 0.6 and for \"not spam\" would be 0.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Posterior Probability**: The updated probability of a class after considering the evidence (features), calculated using Bayes' theorem.\n",
    "Naive Bayes relies on calculating the posterior probability for each class and choosing the class with the highest posterior probability as the predicted label.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q25 What is Laplace smoothing and why is it used in Naive Bayes?\n",
    "Laplace smoothing is a technique used to handle zero probabilities in Naive Bayes by adding a small constant (usually 1) to the frequency counts of each feature. This ensures that no probability is ever zero, improving the robustness of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q26 Can Naive Bayes be used for regression tasks?\n",
    "Naive Bayes is primarily used for classification tasks. While it is not inherently designed for regression, adaptations like the Gaussian Naive Bayes can handle continuous features but are still used for classification.\n",
    "For regression tasks, other models like Naive Bayes regression (a variant of Naive Bayes) or regression algorithms such as linear regression are typically used.\n",
    "Naive Bayes can be adapted for continuous data, it remains a classification model, and its use in regression is not typical.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q27 How do you handle missing values in Naive Bayes?\n",
    "Missing values in Naive Bayes can be handled by:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imputation**: Filling in missing values with the most common value or the mean/median.\n",
    "**Ignoring Missing Values**: During probability calculation, ignoring features with missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q28 What are some common applications of Naive Bayes?\n",
    "1. **Spam Filtering**: Classifying emails as spam or not spam based on the content of the email.\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of text data, such as social media posts or product reviews.\n",
    "3. **Document Classification**: Categorizing documents into predefined classes, such as news articles into topics (e.g., sports, politics, technology).\n",
    "4. **Medical Diagnosis**: Predicting the likelihood of a disease based on symptoms and medical data.\n",
    "5. **Text Classification**: Classifying text into categories, like classifying tweets as related to a specific topic or not.\n",
    "6. **Recommendation Systems**: Predicting user preferences or interests based on previous behavior or data, particularly in e-commerce or entertainment.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Naive Bayes is particularly useful for **high-dimensional** datasets, such as text classification and when the features are conditionally independent (or approximately so).\n",

    "#### Q30 How does Naive Bayes handle categorical features with a large number of categories?\n",
    "Naive Bayes handles categorical features by calculating the conditional probability of each category given the class. With a large number of categories, this can lead to sparse data and zero probabilities for some categories. Laplace smoothing can help mitigate this by ensuring non-zero probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q31 What is the curse of dimensionality, and how does it affect machine learning algorithms?\n",
    "The curse of dimensionality refers to the challenges that arise when working with high-dimensional data. As the number of features increases, the volume of the feature space grows exponentially, making the data sparse. This sparsity makes it difficult for algorithms to find patterns and can lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q32 Explain the Bias-Variance Tradeoff and its implications for machine learning models.\n",
    "**Bias** : Error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm. High bias can cause underfitting.\n",
    "**Variance**: Error due to too much complexity in the learning algorithm. High variance can cause overfitting.\n",
    "The **bias-variance tradeoff** is about finding the right balance between bias and variance to achieve optimal model performance and good generalization on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q33 What is cross-validation, and why is it used?\n",
    "Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a model by splitting the data into multiple training and validation sets. The most common form is **k-fold cross-validation**, where the data is divided into k subsets, and the model is trained and evaluated k times, each time using a different subset as the validation set. It helps in ensuring that the model's performance is robust and not dependent on a particular train-test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q34 Explain the difference between parametric and non-parametric machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "**Parametric Algorithms**: Assume a specific form for the function mapping inputs to outputs and have a fixed number of parameters (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression).\n",
    "**Non-Parametric Algorithms**: Do not assume a specific form for the function and can grow in complexity with more data (e.g., k-nearest neighbors, decision trees).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q35 What is feature scaling, and why is it important in machine learning?\n",
    "Feature scaling involves normalizing  or standardizing the range of independent features in the data. It is important because many machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, k-NN, gradient descent-based methods) perform better when features are on a similar scale, improving model performance and convergence speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q36 What is regularization, and why is it used in machine learning?\n",
    "Regularization involves adding a penalty term to the loss function to prevent overfitting by discouraging overly complex models. It helps improve generalization. Common types include L1 (Lasso), which promotes sparsity, and L2 (Ridge), which penalizes large coefficients, both improving model performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q37 Explain the concept of ensemble learning and give an example.\n",
    "Ensemble learning involves combining the predictions of multiple models to improve performance. An example is a random forest, which combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to produce a more accurate and robust model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q38 What is the difference between bagging and boosting?\n",
    "**Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**: Involves training multiple models independently on different subsets of the data and then combining their predictions (e.g., random forests).\n",
    "**Boosting**: Involves training models sequentially, each trying to correct the errors of the previous model, and then combining their predictions (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q39 What is the difference between a generative model and a discriminative model?\n",
    "**Generative Model**: Models the joint probability distribution of the input features and the output labels, allowing for the generation of new data (e.g., Naive Bayes, Hidden Markov Models).\n",
    "**Discriminative Model**: Models the conditional probability of the output labels given the input features, focusing on the decision boundary (e.g., logistic regression, SVM).\n",
    "Discriminative models typically perform better for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q40 Explain the concept of batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "**Batch Gradient Descent**: Calculates the gradient of the loss function using the entire training dataset and updates the model parameters once per cycle. It can be computationally expensive for large datasets.\n",
    "**Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: Calculates the gradient using a single training example at a time and updates the model parameters after each example. This makes SGD faster and can escape local minima, but it introduces more noise in the updates.\n",
    "Mini-batch gradient descent is a compromise between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q41 What is the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, and how does it work?\n",
    "KNN is a non-parametric algorithm used for classification and regression. It works by finding the k closest training examples to the input example and predicting the output based on the majority class (for classification) or the average (for regression) of the k neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q42 What are the disadvantages of the K-nearest neighbors algorithm?\n",
    "1. Computationally expensive, especially with large datasets, since it requires calculating distances to all training points.\n",
    "2. Sensitive to the choice of k and the distance metric.\n",
    "3. It Can be affected by irrelevant features and noisy data, as they can distort distance calculations. \n",
    "4. It also doesn't perform well with high-dimensional data due to the \"**curse of dimensionality**.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q43 Explain the concept of one-hot encoding and its use in machine learning.\n",
    "One-hot encoding is a technique for converting categorical variables into a binary matrix representation. Each category is represented by a binary vector with a 1 in the position corresponding to the category and 0s elsewhere. It is used to make categorical data suitable for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Q44 What is feature selection, and why is it important in machine learning?\n",
    "Feature selection is the process of identifying and selecting a subset of relevant features (or variables) for use in model training. It is important because it can enhance model performance by eliminating irrelevant or redundant features, reduce overfitting by focusing on the most important predictors, and decrease computational cost by reducing the number of features that need to be processed. Additionally, feature selection can improve model interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q45 Explain the concept of cross-entropy loss and its use in classification tasks.\n",
    "Cross-entropy loss, also known as log loss, measures the difference between the true labels (actual distribution) and the predicted probabilities (predicted distribution) generated by the model. It quantifies how well the model‚Äôs predicted probabilities match the actual labels, with a lower cross-entropy indicating better performance. \n",
    "It's commonly used in binary and multi-class classification tasks, and it encourages the model to output probabilities close to the true label probabilities. A key aspect is that it heavily penalizes incorrect predictions with high confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q46 What is the difference between batch learning and online learning?\n",
    "**Batch Learning**: The model is trained on the entire training dataset at once, and it doesn't update until retrained with a new dataset. This approach is suitable for situations where data is static and available in bulk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Online Learning**: The model is trained incrementally, processing data one sample (or a small batch) at a time. It can adapt to changes in data over time, making it ideal for streaming data or situations where data is too large to fit into memory all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference is that online learning allows models to continuously update as new data arrives, while batch learning requires retraining on the full dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q47 Explain the concept of grid search and its use in hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "Grid search is an exhaustive search technique where a predefined set of hyperparameters is systematically evaluated to find the combination that maximizes model performance, typically using cross-validation. It is commonly used for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models. However, it can be computationally expensive, especially when the grid is large, as it evaluates every possible combination of hyperparameters. Additionally, grid search does not always guarantee finding the optimal combination, especially for high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q48 What are the advantages and disadvantages of decision trees?\n",
    "**Advantages**: \n",
    "Easy to interpret, can handle both numerical and categorical data, non-parametric, can capture complex relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**: \n",
    "Prone to overfitting, sensitive to small changes in the data, can be biased if one class dominates and poor generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q49 What is the difference between L1 and L2 regularization?\n",
    "\n",
    "**L1 Regularization (Lasso)**: Adds the absolute value of the coefficients as a penalty term. Can lead to sparse models (many coefficients are zero).\n",
    "Lasso is useful when you suspect that many features are irrelevant or when you need a more interpretable model with fewer features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**L2 Regularization (Ridge)**: Adds the squared value of the coefficients as a penalty term. Tends to distribute the error across all coefficients.\n",
    "Ridge regularization is often used when you want to shrink coefficients evenly without eliminating any features.\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 (Lasso) can result in sparse models by zeroing out some coefficients, while L2 (Ridge) tends to shrink coefficients smoothly without eliminating them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a combination of both (L1 + L2), known as **Elastic Net**, is sometimes used to balance the benefits of both regularization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q50 What are some common preprocessing techniques used in machine learning?\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Q51 What is the difference between a parametric and non-parametric algorithm? Give examples of each.\n",
    "**Parametric Algorithm**: Assumes a specific form for the function and has a fixed number of parameters (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-Parametric Algorithm**: Does not assume a specific form and can grow in complexity with more data (e.g., k-nearest neighbors, decision trees).\n",

    "Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model by dividing the dataset into multiple subsets and training the model on some subsets while validating it on the remaining subsets. The most common form is k-fold cross-validation, where the data is split into k subsets (folds), and the model is trained and evaluated k times, each time using a different fold as the validation set and the remaining k-1 folds as the training set. Cross-validation helps to ensure that the model's performance is robust and not dependent on a particular train-test split, reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",

    "#### Q61 What is the curse of dimensionality, and how does it affect machine learning algorithms?\n",
    "The **curse of dimensionality** refers to the difficulties that arise when working with high-dimensional data. As the number of features increases:\n",
    "- The volume of the feature space grows exponentially, causing the data to become sparse.\n",
    "- This sparsity makes it harder for algorithms to identify meaningful patterns and can lead to **overfitting**.\n",
    "- It increases **computational complexity** and can reduce the performance of algorithms, especially distance-based ones like KNN, because the distance between points becomes less informative in high dimensions.\n",

    "- **Normalization** (scaling to a range, e.g., [0, 1])\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important because many machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, k-NN, gradient descent-based methods) rely on distances or gradients.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q67 What are the assumptions of the Naive Bayes algorithm?\n",
    "1. **Conditional Independence** : All features are assumed to be independent given the class label.\n",
    "2. **Feature Distribution** : For continuous features, it is often assumed that they follow a normal distribution. However, for categorical features, probability distributions (like multinomial or Bernoulli) are used.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q71 How does the decision boundary of a Naive Bayes classifier look like for binary classification tasks?\n",
    "The decision boundary of a Naive Bayes classifier is typically linear or piecewise linear in the feature space.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q73 How does Naive Bayes handle numerical instability issues?\n",
    "Numerical instability in Naive Bayes can arise from multiplying many small probabilities, leading to underflow. This can be handled by using logarithms to convert the product of probabilities into a sum of log-probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q74 What is the Laplacian correction, and when is it used in Naive Bayes?\n",
    "The Laplacian correction, also known as Laplace smoothing, adds a small constant (usually 1) to the frequency counts of each feature to handle zero probabilities. This ensures that no probability is zero, which is important when certain feature-category pairs are absent in the training data. It helps improve the robustness of the model, particularly in cases of sparse data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q75 Can Naive Bayes be used for regression tasks?\n",
    "Naive Bayes is primarily designed for **classification tasks**. While it is not inherently used for **regression**, adaptations like **Gaussian Naive Bayes** can handle continuous features. However, these adaptations are still used for **classification** (predicting discrete outcomes) rather than regression (predicting continuous values). \n",
    "\n",
    "For regression tasks, other algorithms like **Naive Bayes for regression** (a variant) or **linear regression** would be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q76 Explain the concept of conditional independence assumption in Naive Bayes.\n",

    "2. **Sensitive to Probability Estimation**: Naive Bayes is sensitive to how probabilities are estimated, and inaccurate estimation can hurt model performance.\n",
    "3. **Less Accurate than Complex Models**: Naive Bayes can be less accurate than more complex algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests) when the true relationships between features are more intricate.\n",

    "Additionally, it may struggle with **high-dimensional data** and **outliers** in certain cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q79 Explain the concept of smoothing in Naive Bayes.\n",
    "**Smoothing in Naive Bayes** involves adding a small constant (e.g., 1) to the frequency counts of each feature to prevent **zero probabilities** for unseen feature values. This ensures that no probability is exactly zero, which could otherwise lead to issues when making predictions. A common smoothing technique is **Laplace smoothing**, but **Additive smoothing** is also used in some cases.\n",
